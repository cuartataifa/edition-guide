# Lifetime adjustments to temporary values

ðŸš§ The 2024 Edition has not yet been released and hence this section is still "under construction".
More information may be found in the tracking issue at <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/124085> and <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/123739>.

## Summary

This Edition observes two breaking changes to the handling of lifetimes assigned to temporary values, in the following two cases.

- In `if let $pat = $expr { .. } else { .. }` expression, the temporary values generated from evaluating `$expr` will be dropped before the program enters the `else` branch.
- Temporary values generated in evaluation of the [tail expression] of a [function] or closure body, or a [block] are instead dropped before local variables are dropped with Edition 2024.

## Details

Edition 2024 brings about improvements in handling lifetime of temporary values, to reduce expected retention of such values and surprising runtime behaviour thereof. First it involves an `if let` expression. Up until Edition 2021, `if let` as an expression assigns a lifetime that can extend beyond the `if let` expression itself.

```rust,edition2021
// Up until Edition 2021
call(
    another_call(if let Enum::Pattern { value } = &self.get_value().method() {
        Some(value)
    } else {
        None
    })
);
```

In this example, the temporary value generated from evaluating the sub-expression `self.get_value()` will only be dropped at the end of the semicolon, even though at that program point its last use as a function argument for `another_call` is exhausted. Edition 2024 makes a correction to this lifetime assignment by shortening it up until the point where the then-block is completely evaluated or the program control enters the `else` block.

```rust,edition2024
// From Edition 2024
call(
    another_call(if let Enum::Pattern { value } = &self.get_value().method() {
        Some(value)
    }
    // At this point, `self.get_value()` is dropped
    else {
        None
    })
);
```

The other lifetime assignment rule changed by Edition 2024 involves tail expressions. It often comes as a surprise that, up until Edition 2021, temporary values in tail expressions are dropped later than the local variable bindings, as in the following example.

```rust,edition2021
// Up until Edition 2021
fn main() {
    let m = std::sync::Mutex::new(());
    *m.lock().unwrap() // error[E0597]: `m` does not live long enough
}
```

This yields the following error with Edition 2021.

```
error[E0597]: `m` does not live long enough
 --> src/main.rs:3:6
  |
2 |     let m = std::sync::Mutex::new(());
  |         - binding `m` declared here
3 |     *m.lock().unwrap()
  |      ^----------------
  |      |
  |      borrowed value does not live long enough
  |      a temporary with access to the borrow is created here ...
4 |     // 
5 | }
  | -
  | |
  | `m` dropped here while still borrowed
  | ... and the borrow might be used here, when that temporary is dropped and runs the `Drop` code for type `MutexGuard`
  |
help: consider adding semicolon after the expression so its temporaries are dropped sooner, before the local variables declared by the block are dropped
  |
3 |     *m.lock().unwrap();
  |                       +
```

Edition 2024 intends to make correction, so that the temporary value `m.lock().unwrap` is dropped first, followed by dropping the local variable `m`.

## Migration

It is always safe to rewrite `if let` with a `match`. Edition 2024 comes with an non-enforcing lint `if_let_rescope` which suggests a fix when a lifetime issue arises due to this change, or the lint detects that a temporary value with a custom, non-trivial `Drop` destructor is generated from the right-hand side of the `if let`. For instance, the earlier example involving `call` and `another_call` may be rewritten into the following, when the suggestion from `cargo fix` is accepted.

```rust,edition2024
call(
    another_call(match &self.get_value().method() {
        Enum::Pattern { value } => {
            Some(value)
        }
        _ => {
            None
        }
    })
);
// `self.get_value()` is dropped at this point, which exactly matches Edition 2021 semantics
```

Edition 2024 cannot deduce with complete confidence that the program semantics are preserved when the lifetime of such temporary values are shortened. For this reason, this lint remains non-binding but users are encouraged to set its level to `warn` in order to allow manual auditing.

Unfortunately, there is no semantics-preserving rewrite to shortened lifetime for temporary values in tail expressions, with the implementation of [^RFC3606]. A lint `tail_expr_drop_order` is introduced to detect if a temporary value with a custom, non-trivial `Drop` destructor is generated in a tail expression. Users are again encouraged to set its level to `warn` so that the temporary values could be audited with respect to the change.

[^RFC3606]: Details are documented at [RFC 3606](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3606)
